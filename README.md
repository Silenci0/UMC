# Uncletopia Map Chooser

This is a fork of [Universal Map Chooser](https://github.com/Silenci0/UMC) with
patches applied for the Uncletopia Experience™. It is **not** meant to be
_universal_, nor is it meant to cover every use case. Furthermore, it is likely
to contain ugly hacks and, in fact, have _less_ functionality than the original
version of the UMC as well as be Team Fortress 2 specific. Therefore, patches
that make this code "better" will not be accepted, however if you are running an
Uncletopia clone, you will probably want to use this.

Features will be added and removed as we need them on Uncletopia, so this
project **will** be unstable. You **should** be using the original UMC.
